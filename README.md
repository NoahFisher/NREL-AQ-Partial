NREL-AQ-Partial
===============
This is a portion of code from an air quality model I have created for the National Renewable Energy Lab. 

The model uses postgreSQL as the database and psycopg2 to connect to the database. 

The code shown models emissions from fuel combustion from non-harvest and harvest operations, fertilizer and chemical application, and fugitive particulate matter. 

There are 5 feedstocks of interest: Corn Grain, Corn Stover, Wheat Straw, Switchgrass, and Forest Residue. 

There are 7 pollutants of interest: NOx, SOx, CO, VOC, PM10, PM2.5, and NH3. 

Please don't hesitate to contact me with questions about the finer details of the model at noah(dot)fisher(at)gmail(dot)com
